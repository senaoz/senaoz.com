# From the Classroom to the Office:<br />Tips for Managing School and Work

As someone who balances being a student and a part-time software developer, I can tell you that it's not always an easy task. It takes dedication, and careful planning to ensure that both aspects of your life are managed effectively. In this blog post, I will share some tips and strategies that have helped me juggle these two roles.

I work remotely, and while working in the field of software, there is no structure that limits my working hours other than daily meetings, but this comfort can also disrupt my social life and work balance. Therefore, I clearly define my working days (3d/week for me) and stick to completing my tasks during my working hours.

### Create a schedule and stick to it
The first step to successfully balancing school and work is to create a schedule that works for you. This may mean that you need to wake up earlier in the morning or work later in the evening. Whatever the case may be, it's important to make sure that you have dedicated time for school, work, and yourself. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you are able to meet all of your deadlines and your responsibilities to your friends/family.

### Learn to prioritize
When you're juggling school and work, it's important to prioritize your tasks. Make a list of all the things that you need to accomplish, and then rank them in order of importance. This will help you focus on the most critical tasks first and ensure that you're not wasting time on things that can wait.

### Use technology to your advantage
As a software developer, you're probably already familiar with the latest technology. Use this knowledge to your advantage by finding tools and apps that can help you manage your time more effectively. There are plenty of productivity apps out there that can help you stay on track and ensure that you're making the most of your time.

As I start a new semester, the first thing I do is transfer all my courses and lab hours to my calendar. It's usually helpful for me to group them under two separate headings: the important ones and the ones that can be easy to give up. I named both 'academic' in the calendar with different colors, but the difference is clear :).

### Communicate with your coworkers and professors
It's important to communicate with your coworkers and professors about your schedule and workload. Let them know that you're juggling multiple responsibilities and ask for their understanding and support. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to ask for help.

### Take care of yourself
Finally, it's important to take care of yourself when you're juggling school and work. Make sure that you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking breaks when you need them. Remember that your health and well-being are just as important as your school and work responsibilities.

**In conclusion, balancing being a student and work can be challenging, but with proper planning, communication, and self-care, it's possible to succeed in both areas.**
